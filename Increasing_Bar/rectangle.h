             Removed some redundant and complex functions. Streamlined
	     the code to make it a better example.

   This file defines the functions that form a library to manage 
   vitual windows on a character screen. The window is not marked in any
   way on the screen (marking it out, if necessary, is a purpose of the 
   calling program), but allows the user to position the cursor and print
   inside a window (almost) as if it were an independent screen. 

   In the examples that preceed the functions, we assume that we have
   a screen with 10 rows and 40 columns and in it we open a "window"
   of 5 rows and 15 column beginning at position 2, 19. The situation
   is therefore this:

   0                                        39
    +----------------------------------------+
  0 |                                        |
    |                   +---------------+    |
    |                   |               |    |
    |                   |               |    |
    |                   |               |    |
    |                   |               |    |
    |                   |               |    |
    |                   +---------------+    |
    |                                        |

    +----------------------------------------+

    Of course, the library doesn't mark the window on the screen, and
    in order to remark this fact, we shall write down the screen as:

                       19             33
     0                  v             v    39
    +----------------------------------------+
  0 |                                        |
    |                                        |
    |                                        | < 2
    |                                        | 
    |                                        |
    |                                        |
    |                                        | < 6
    |                                        | 
    |                                        |
   9|                                        |
    +----------------------------------------+


    NOTE:
    These functions are implemented using ASCII ESC codes for the control
    of the cursor. This might produce some incompatibility problem with 
    Windows and MS/DOS systems.

    Note also that the ESC code consider that the cursor coordinates
    begin with 1 (1, 1 is the position of the top left character of
    the screen). However, following the standard computing convention,
    this library will consider that the coordinates begin with 0. So,
    (0,0) are the coordinates of the top-left-most character in the
    screen and for a screen of size, say 40x80, the bottom-right
    character has coordinates (39,79).

  will be truncated.
