INTRODUCCIÓN A LA HISTORIA, ESTO VA AL PRINCIPIO Y MIENTRAS SE DISPLAYEA EL MAPA 01.

Everything started a sunny and lovely day, in a very very far away land called "CIUDAD DEL VAL", this city was
quiet and lovely until a great disaster came to the lives of all citizens. A mysterious man came to the city, this
man was called Moberto Ramabini. Moberto's plan was to spread a disease around the city that was highly infectious
and made all sick people act as zombies, the infected people repeated the same phrase all the time in a loop:
SO FAR SO GOOD, SO FAR SO GOOD, SO FAR SOO GOOD, SO FAR SO GOOD if some of these "zombies" touch you, you can 
get infected and they can kill you. 
Fortunately in our story there is also a hero and that is you!! You are not affected by Ramabini's disease so 
you are the chosen one to end up with this madness. Alvaro Del Mal (the mayor of the town) gave you some stuff to 
start your mission, he is too busy investigating new ways to skip class without being fired. He is a teacher as well 
but he needs to keep a secret identity as mayor of "CIUDAD DEL VAL", he is like Superman and Clark Kent, thats why
he doesn't care about his job as a teacher, it is only a fake identity, like Superman being a journalist, but this
is another story. Well, the fact is that you are alone here, kill all the "zombies" without mercy and complete
all the missions (Not Not, Mazes, 21, etc...) to get cool stuff to kick Ramabini's ass!! Good Luck!!!
