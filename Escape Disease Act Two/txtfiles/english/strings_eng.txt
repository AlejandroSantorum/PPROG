Welcome to our game! We're glad to show you how to play this game by the best way
12
we can think of, just by telling you the basics and then let you by yourself in the game.
13
First of all, there will be three different "modes" inside the game: battle mode,
14
mission mode and town mode. Let's begin with battle mode.
15
In battle mode, you will be fighting some zombies. You'll move with arrow keys,
16
swap between weapons with QE and shooting with WASD. Now try it out for a little bit.
17
If you forget this, don't worry, these instructions will appear in the
18
rectangle at the right.
19
When you are done with them, go to the G(Gate).
20
There are many different missions, so for each one you will see the instructions
21
on the rectangle on the right.
22
Finally, in the town mode, you'll just wander around the town,
23
so arrow keys just as in battle mode. Also, you can use your objects to keep
24
your HUNGER, HYDRATION, HEALTH and GUNPOWDER up.

Now that you know how to play, let's get started with the main game.
1000
Everything started a sunny and lovely day, in a far away land called "CIUDAD DEL VAL".
1001
This city was quiet and lovely until a great disaster came to the lives of all citizens.
1002
A mysterious man came to the city, this man was called Moberto Ramabini. Moberto's plan
1003
was to spread a disease around the city that was highly infectious and made all sick
1004
people act as zombies, the infected people repeated the same phrase all the time in a loop:
1005
SO FAR SO GOOD, SO FAR SO GOOD. If some of these "zombies" touch you, you may get infected
1006
and die.
1007
Fortunately, in our story there is also a hero, and that is you!! You are not affected
1008
by Ramabini's disease, so you are the chosen one to end up with this madness. Alvaro del
1009
Mal (the mayor of the town) gave you some stuff to start your mission, he is too busy
1010
investigating new ways to skip class without being fired. He is a teacher but he needs
1011
to keep a secret identity as mayor of "CIUDAD DEL VAL", he is like Superman and Clark
1012
Kent, that's why he doesn't care about his job as a teacher, it is only a fake identity,
1013
like Superman being a journalist, but this is another story. Well, the fact is that
1014
you are not alone here, kill all the zombies without mercy and complete all the
1015
missions to get cool stuff to kick Ramabini's ass!! Good luck!!
1016
Well, here are your first rivals, try to kill them without being injured!
1017
You did it pretty well, now continue your adventure, do not forget to use MEDICINES,
1018
FOOD or DRINKS if you need them! And you have found a gun, you should use it.
1019
Now follow the path, there is a bonus level, follow the instructions and do your best!
1020
WELCOME to NOT NOT, a game for fast and smart people. You have to pass 10 screens. If
1021
you fail one you'll lose and you'll get less points, the fastest you do it the more
1022
items you get!
1023
Time to rest, just make sure your HUNGER, HEALTH and HYDRATION are good. The town hall
1024
is closed because Del Mal is teaching (this happen once every one or two years).
1025
Go to G when you are ready to continue.
1026
Defeat them!!
1027
Solve the Maze!! Be careful with your resources!
1028
Go to the Town Hall. You can eat, drink or heal yourself if you need.
1029
DEL MAL-Hi there! I'm Alvaro del Mal. It is great to meet you formally. You are our hero!!
1030
Ramabini is now weaker thanks to you!! You have cleaned the North zone, but it was
1031
the easiest one!! Now I will drive you to the East, there will be more monsters but
1032
I will give you cool stuff.
1033
GO GO GO GO!!
1034
Welcome to 21, press UP to get a number between 1 and 7, press DOWN if you want to
1035
quit with the amount you have got. Try to get 21 to get the best stuff!! If you are
1036
very greedy and you get more than 21 you won't get anything.
1037
Heal yourself and prepare for what is about to come! Also, you've just found a revolver.
1038
Defeat them, they are a bit stronger because Ramabini is getting closer!
1039
Follow the instructions and get a lot of items!
1040
Visit the Town Hall to see the mayor!!
1041
DEL MAL-Hi there, my friend!! You did it pretty well!! I have more adventures for you.
1042
You need to clean the last zone, this is the last time you will visit this wonderful
1043
town if you don't kill those last zombies! I have some presents for you. Good luck
1044
and defeat Ramabini!
10445
Now head to the South!
1045
GO GO GO! I can feel Ramabini is somewhere near!
1046
Smash it!
1047
That classic game. This is a bonus level, have fun!
1048
You are almost there!
1049
The zombies have conquered the town! DEFEAT THEM! PROTECT THE CITY!
1050
RAMABINI-HEY THERE!! I AM RAMABINI MUAHAHAHA, and yes, as you thought I entered CIUDAD DEL
1051
MAL with the Primary Key! You don't have enough power to defeat me!
1052
(Ramabini dies in agony).
1053
???-Here I am to help! Oh wow, did you actually already killed him? Seem that I'm a bit
1054
late. I was looking for Del Mal but since I couldn't find him anywhere I came here without
1055
him. Nice to meet you, I'm Santini.
1056
DEL MAL-Oh, sorry for being late, I was, umm, thinking about a strategy to defeat Ramabini
1057
in the pub, but seems you didn't need a strategy. Well done. By the way, Santini, could
1058
you correct the 2nd EDAT assignment for me? Being a mayor is such a time consuming task.
1059
SANTINI-........... -.-
