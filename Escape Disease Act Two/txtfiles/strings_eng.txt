Welcome to our game! We're glad to show you how to play this game by the best way
12
we can think of, just by telling you the basics and then let you by yourself in the game.
13
First of all, there will be three different "modes" inside the game: battle mode,
14
mission mode and town mode. Let's begin with battle mode.
15
In battle mode, you will be fighting some zombies. You'll move with arrow keys,
16
swap between weapons with QE and shooting with WASD. Now try it out for a little bit.
17
If you forget this, don't worry, these instructions will appear in the
18
rectangle at the right.
19
When you are done with them, go to the G(Gate).
20
There are many different missions, so for each one you will see the instructions
21
on the rectangle on the right.
22
Finally, in the town mode, you'll just wander around the town,
23
so arrow keys just as in battle mode.
